Revision history for MOBY-Client

1.04
	   *  Fix bug in CollectionArticle, SimpleInput, SecondaryArticle, and 
		  SimpleArticle that caused objects created to have 'memory'.
	   *  Updated the MOBY::Client::ServiceInstance module to reflect
		  the fact that services can have >= 0 MobyUnitTests.
	   *  In MOBY::RDF::Utils, fixed typo in the 
		  ref ($self)  =~ m// statement
	   *  MOBY::RDF::Parsers::ServiceParser, added a loop to parse out 
		  unit tests in those instances that more than one is defined, 
		  and added code to parse out the datatype/namespace/servicetype 
		  term from a uri/lsid.
	   *  Added the function 'raw_execute' to MOBY::Async::Service to
		  allow calling of services with raw XML similarly to the method
		  in MOBY::Client::Service.
	   *  Fixed typo in MOBY::Client::Service that refered to POST 
		  services as category 'post' rather than 'cgi'
	   *  Added the category 'cgi-async' to the list of service
	      categories that are allowed.

       * changes to makefile reflecting the cpan addition of wsrf

	     test information is available for the service instance.

1.02   16 May 2008
	   * fixed bug in MOBY::Client::Central::DUMP that resulted
		 in an error ('Not an ARRAY reference at 
		 MOBY/Client/Central.pm line 1927') being raised.
		 Thanks to Pieter Neerincx for finding the bug and a
		 solution.
		  
	   * fixed bug that allowed service types to be registered 
		 with empty ISA relationships.
			  
	   * MOBY WSRF implementation was not WSRF compliant in some 
		 points, and the same happened with sample code. Both the 
		 libraries and the generated WSDL have been fixed.
