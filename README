Perl MOBY version 1.00

======================

This directory contains the Perl implementation of the MOBY
Client codebase.

INSTALLATION

To install *all* the general Perl MOBY libraries on your system, 
type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

There are several dependencies used by the MOBY::Client codebase
that are not cleanly installed during the make install phase 
of installation. 

If you are having any problems automatically getting the dependencies 
to install properly, please either try command line cpan or download
each dependency independently and install them as per their installation
instructions.

WRSF::Lite

If module 'WSRF::Lite' is not installed and you are
thinking about developing BioMOBY Asynchronous service, 
then following is for you!

Unfortunately, this module is not available on CPAN 
and must be manually installed. Some of the 
dependencies are beta and as such, may not be stable.

Try downloading it from the following link:

http://www.rcs.manchester.ac.uk/research/projects/wsrflite

or you can try searching the net with Google using the keywords:

	'perl WSRF::Lite'
